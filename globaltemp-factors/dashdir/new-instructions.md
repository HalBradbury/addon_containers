### Instructions
- **"Learn" tab**: Select one of the contributing factors.
- THEN - click the "Play" button that appears at top-left of the graph.
- "Pause" button puts graphing on hold; "Play" resumes graphing.
- Words under the graph depend upon which factor was chosen.
- **"Explore" tab**: Select one or more of the factors to display. Click again to deselect.
- **Annotate**: The **"Explore" tab** (not the *Learn tab*) includes options for adding annotations using lines, circles and text.
  - Use the "Draw Line" or "Draw Circle" buttons visible between tab labels and the graph itself.
  - To remove a drawn shape, select it then click the "Erase active shape" button.
  - Also, text entered in the box below the figure will be reproduced on the image.
- **Zoom**: Use "Zoom" button, then the "Pan" button. OR - click-drag a box around the portion you want to see zoomed in. The little "home" button is for resetting the axes.
- **Save** any image using the "*Download plot as a png*" button (the little camera).
- Optional feedback at the end of this page will help us improve this resource

### Definitions
**Temperature anomaly**: the difference between *measured* and *average global temperature between 1880 and 1910*. The black "observed" curve is the [GISS global land and ocean temperature anomaly record](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs_v3/) starting in 1880.

Colored temperature anomaly curves are the *calculated (or 'modeled') estimates* of how much each indicated **factor** or "contributor" affects the global temperature.

**Source of curves**: Each factor was simulated five times, with different initial conditions. Each curve shown is the average of these five runs. GISS researchers laid out their historical simulations in detail in this [article](https://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/abs/mi08910y.html).

**Variance**: All the lines on the plot include the variance from the 1880-1910 average of the parameter.

The graph and writeups were inspired by the [Bloomberg Climate Change graph](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-whats-warming-the-world/).
