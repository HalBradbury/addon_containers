# Hydrogeology Demos

This is one of several dashboard apps to support learning of hydrogeology concepts and corresponding basic analysis. Each app has relevant sources and attributions at the bottom of it's app screen.

## Unconfined Flow with Recharge
This demo is based on the supplemental file for the book [Hydrogeological Properties of Earth Materials and Principles of Groundwater Flow](https://gw-project.org/books/hydrogeologic-properties-of-earth-materials-and-principles-of-groundwater-flow/), by the [Groundwater Project](https://gw-project.org/).

The first plot plots hydraulic head. It shows the location of the groundwater divide. The plot has qualitative arrows indicating the direction and magnitude of flow.

The second plot plots q'_x, the flow per unit width. The groundwater divide occurs where q'_x=0.
